XAMPP POST DATA FIX CHECKLIST
============================

STEP 1: Test Basic POST Functionality
------------------------------------
1. Open http://localhost/travelplanner/post_test.php in your browser
2. Fill out the form and click "Send POST Data"
3. Check if debug_post.txt file is created in the same folder
4. Open debug_post.txt and see if it contains the form data

IF debug_post.txt is EMPTY or NOT CREATED:
   → There's a server configuration issue
   → Continue to Step 2

IF debug_post.txt contains the data:
   → POST is working, the issue is in your booking code
   → Skip to Step 5

STEP 2: Check PHP Configuration
------------------------------
1. Open http://localhost/travelplanner/phpinfo.php
2. Search for these settings (Ctrl+F):
   - post_max_size (should be 8M or higher)
   - upload_max_filesize (should be 2M or higher)
   - max_input_vars (should be 1000 or higher)
   - file_uploads (should be On)

3. If any are wrong, edit C:\xampp\php\php.ini:
   - Find the line and change the value
   - Save the file
   - Restart Apache in XAMPP Control Panel

STEP 3: Check File Permissions
-----------------------------
1. Right-click on your travelplanner folder
2. Properties → Security tab
3. Make sure your user has "Modify" permissions
4. If not, click "Edit" → "Allow" for "Modify"

STEP 4: Check for .htaccess Issues
---------------------------------
1. Look for .htaccess file in your travelplanner folder
2. If it exists, temporarily rename it to .htaccess_backup
3. Test POST again
4. If it works, the .htaccess was blocking POST requests

STEP 5: Check Error Logs
-----------------------
1. Open XAMPP Control Panel
2. Click "Logs" button next to Apache
3. Look for any errors when you submit the form
4. Also check PHP error log

STEP 6: Test in Different Browser
--------------------------------
1. Try Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
2. Try incognito/private mode
3. Disable browser extensions temporarily

STEP 7: If Nothing Works
-----------------------
1. Backup your travelplanner folder
2. Uninstall XAMPP completely
3. Download fresh XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org/
4. Install and copy your travelplanner folder back
5. Test again

STEP 8: Once POST Works
----------------------
1. Your booking ticket download should work
2. Test with a real booking
3. Check if PDF contains data

TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS:
- Make sure Apache is running in XAMPP Control Panel
- Make sure you're accessing via http://localhost not file://
- Check Windows Firewall isn't blocking Apache
- Try running XAMPP as Administrator
